<h21>GitHub Analysis</h21>
<p>
Thanks to the large number of diverse open source projects available in software forges such as GitHub, it becomes possible to evaluate some long-standing questions about software engineering practices. Each of these project repositories hosts source code along with entire evolution history, description, mailing lists, bug database, etc. I implemented a number of code analysis and text analysis tools to gather different metrics from GitHub project repositories. Then applying a series of advanced data analysis methods from machine learning, random networks, visualization, and regression analysis techniques, I shed some light on how to improve software quality and developers’ productivity.
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square">

  <li>
  <strong>Effect of programming languages on software quality.</strong> To investigate whether
  a programming language is the right tool for the job, we gathered a very large data set from
  GitHub (728 projects, 63M lines of code, 29K authors, 1.5M commits, in 17 languages). Using a
  mixed-methods approach, combining multiple regression modeling with visualization and text
  analytics, we studied the effect of language features such as static v.s. dynamic typing,
  strong v.s. weak typing on software quality. By triangulating findings from different
  methods, and controlling for confounding effects such as code size, project age, and
  contributors, we observed that a language design choice does have a significant, but modest
  effect on software quality (<a href="Publication.html#paper-lang">see our FSE'14 paper</a>).
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
  <strong>API stability and adoption in the Android Ecosystem.</strong> In today’s software
  ecosystem, which is primarily governed by web, cloud, and mobile technologies, APIs perform a
  key role to connect disparate software. Big players like Google, FaceBook, Microsoft
  aggressively publish new APIs to accommodate new feature requests, bugs fixes, and
  performance improvements. We investigated how such fast paced API evolution affects the
  overall software ecosystem? Our study on Android API evolution showed that the developers are
  hesitant to adopt fast evolving, unstable APIs. For instance, while Android updates 115 APIs
  per month on average, clients adopt the new APIs rather slowly, with a median
  lagging period of 16 months. Furthermore, client code with new APIs is typically more defect
  prone than the ones without API adaptation. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first
  work studying API adoption in a large software ecosystem, and the study suggests how to
  promote API adoption and how to facilitate growth of the overall ecosystems 
  (<a href="Publication.html#paper-android">see our ICSM'13 paper</a>).
   </li>
  <br>
   <li>
   <strong>Assert Use in GitHub Projects.</strong>
   Assertions in a program are believed to improve software quality. We conducted a large scale
   study on how developers typically use assertions in C and C++ code and showed that they play
   positive role in improving code quality. We further characterized assertion usage along
   different process and product metrics. Such detailed characterization of assertions will
   help to predict relevant locations of useful assertions and eventually will improve code
   quality (<a href="Publication.html#paper-assert">see our ICSE'15 paper</a>). 
   </li>
</ul>
<!--In another study, I and my colleagues studied gender and tenure diversity in online programming teams and found that both gender and tenure diversity are positive and significant predictors of productivity. These results can inform decision-making on all levels, leading to better outcomes in recruiting and performance [UCTRb’14].

<h21>Cross-System Porting Analysis</h21>

            <p>
            To maintain different variants of the same projects, developers often port similar
            features or bug-fixes from one system to another.  This requires lot of repeated
              work, which is often tedious and error-prone.  To automatically identify the
              repeated work, we designed <a href="Repertoire.html"
                target="_blank">Repertoire</a>, an source code change analysis tool that
              compares the edit contents and the corresponding operations of program patches to
              identify similar changes. Repertoire identifies repetitive changes with 94%
              precision and 84% recall (<a href="Publication.html#paper-rep">see our FSE'12
              tool-demo paper</a>). 
            <br>
            Using Repertoire, we showed that a significant amount duplicate work takes place
            across the BSD product family.  In each BSD release, on average, more than twelve
              thousand lines are ported from peer projects, and more than 25% of active
                developers participate in cross-system porting in each release (<a
                  href="Publication.html#paper-bsd">see our FSE'12 paper</a>).

<h21>SPA: Detecting Copy-Paste Error</h21>

<br>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
    <p>
    To implement repetitive changes, developers usually copy code from an existing
    implementation and then paste and adapt it to fit the new context. An incorrect adaptation
    often leads to a copy-paste error. Such errors are quite common in practice—in the last 3
    years 182 copy-paste errors were reported in Linux. 
    <br>
    In order to automatically detect copy-paste errors, We investigated: (1) What are the
    common types of copy-paste errors? (2) How can they be automatically detected?  By
    analyzing the version histories of FreeBSD and Linux, We found five common types of
    copy-paste errors and then leveraging this categorization We designed a two-stage analysis
    technique to detect and characterize copy-paste errors. The first stage of the analysis,
    SPA, detects and categorizes inconsistencies in repetitive changes based on a static
    control and data dependence analysis.  SPA successfully identifies copy-paste errors with
    65% to 73% precision, an improvement by 14 to 17 percentage points with respect to previous
    tools (<a href="Publication.html#paper-spa">see our ASE'13 paper</a>). 
    <br>
    The second stage of the analysis, SPA++, uses the inconsistencies computed by SPA to direct
    symbolic execution in order to generate program behaviors that are impacted by the
    inconsistencies.  SPA++ further compares these program behaviors leveraging logical
    equivalence checking (implemented with z3 theorem prover) and generates test inputs that
    exercise program paths containing the reported inconsistencies. A case study shows that
    SPA++ can refine the results reported by SPA and help developers analyze copy-paste
    inconsistencies. We collaborated with researchers from NASA for this work.

<h21>Frankencerts: Adversarial SSL/TLS Testing Framework</h21>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>
      Nowadays in open software market, multiple software are available to users that
      provide similar functionality. For example, there exists a pool of popular SSL/TLS
      libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, GnuTLS, NSS, CyaSSL, GnuTLS, PolarSSL, MatrixSSL, etc.) for
      securing network connections from man-in-the-middle attacks. Certificate validation is a
      crucial part of SSL/TLS connection setup. Though implemented differently, the certificate
      validation logic of these different libraries should serve the same purpose, following
      the SSL/TLS protocol, i.e. for a given certificate, all of the libraries should either
      accept or reject it. 
      <br>
      In collaboration with security researchers at the University of
      Texas at Austin, we designed the first large-scale framework for testing certificate
      validation logic in SSL/TLS implementations. First, we generated millions of synthetic
      certificates by randomly mutating parts of real certificates and thus induced unusual
      combinations of extensions and constraints. A valid SSL implementation should be able to
      detect and reject the unusual mutants. Next, using a differential testing framework, we
      checked whether one SSL/TLS implementation accepts a certificate while another rejects
      the same certificate. We used such discrepancies as an oracle for finding flaws in
      individual implementations. We uncovered 208 discrepancies between popular SSL/TLS
      implementations, many of them are caused by serious security vulnerabilities (<a
      href="Publication.html#paper-frank">see our S&P'14 paper</a>).
